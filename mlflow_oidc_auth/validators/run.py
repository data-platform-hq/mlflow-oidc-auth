    artifact write (issue #288). This route is the only one bound to this validator, so

    This route reached NO validator at all: it carries no "/mlflow-artifacts/" marker, so
    _is_proxy_artifact_path was False, and no proto handler was registered for it, so
    _find_validator returned None — and a None validator is not a deny, it falls through
    and is served. That made it a cross-tenant WRITE primitive: MLflow's
    _create_presigned_upload_url takes a caller-supplied run_id, looks up that run's
    artifact_uri, and mints a presigned cloud-storage upload URL for it. Any authenticated
    user could obtain write access to any other tenant's artifact storage.

    It is a proto route (CreatePresignedUploadUrl), so the run id is read via get_run_id,
    which resolves from the exact source MLflow proto-parses. Minting an upload URL is a
    write, so UPDATE on the owning experiment is required.
