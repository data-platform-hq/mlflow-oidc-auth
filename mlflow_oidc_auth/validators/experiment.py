    The value is normalized through MLflow's OWN ``validate_path_is_safe``, which is
    exactly what the artifact handlers run before serving. Calling anything less than
    that whole function drifts from what MLflow acts on, and every step matters:

      1. ``_decode`` unquotes REPEATEDLY, whereas werkzeug percent-decodes a URL only
         once. Parsing the once-decoded value diverged: "%2531%2532/r/artifacts" reaches
         us as "%31%32/r/artifacts" (no match -> DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION, i.e. allow on
         the shipped MANAGE default) while MLflow resolves it to "12/r/artifacts" and
         serves experiment 12's artifacts.
      2. ``_escape_control_characters``.
      3. ``local_file_uri_to_path`` when the value ``is_file_uri`` — so MLflow strips a
         "file:" scheme and serves "file:12/r/artifacts" as "12/r/artifacts". Calling
         only ``_decode`` left that unresolved and fell back to the MANAGE default, which
         reopened the same cross-tenant read/write/delete this function exists to close.
         "FILE:" and "%66ile:" work too, since the scheme test runs after decoding.

    ``validate_path_is_safe`` RAISES for the paths MLflow refuses outright ("..", "#").
    Those fall through to the raw value below, which is safe: MLflow rejects such a
    request with 400 before any artifact handler runs (issue #283).

    An earlier attempt read the experiment id positionally — two segments before the first
    ``artifacts`` component — on the theory that MLflow always lays a run's artifacts out
    as ``<root...>/{experiment_id}/{run_id}/artifacts/...``. The path is entirely
    caller-controlled and MLflow serves it verbatim relative to the artifacts destination,
    so trusting a position in it is trusting the attacker. Both directions were reachable:

      * ``mlartifacts/7/3/runX/artifacts/evil.txt`` — a caller holding a grant on
        experiment 3 and nothing else supplies both the ``artifacts`` component and the
        digit two before it, so the check passes on experiment 3 while MLflow writes the
        bytes inside experiment 7's tree.
      * an ``artifact_location`` whose last segment is digits (``mlflow-artifacts:/teams/12``)
        made every path under it resolve to "12" — denying the rightful owner and granting
        whoever holds experiment 12.

    So resolve it authoritatively. The component before the ``artifacts`` marker is the run
    id; the store knows which experiment that run belongs to and where its artifacts
    actually live. The request is only attributed to that experiment when it genuinely
    falls INSIDE the run's own artifact location — which is what makes an injected digit,
    or a real run id spliced under someone else's prefix, resolve to nothing.

    Returning None here does not deny by itself; it falls through to the caller's handling
    for an unresolvable path (see _get_permission_from_experiment_id_artifact_proxy), so a
    layout this cannot decompose behaves exactly as it did before any of this work.

    Three outcomes, and the distinction between the last two matters a great deal:

    1. The path names an experiment -> the permission store decides. This now works for a
       prefixed artifact root as well, by anchoring on the "artifacts" marker rather than
       on segment 0.

    2. The path names the shared ROOT (``.``, ``%2e``, an empty ``?path=``, or
       ``workspaces/<ws>``) -> DENY. MLflow acts on every tenant's data at once for these,
       so no per-experiment permission can authorize them, and the previous fallback to
       ``config.DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION`` — which ships as MANAGE — made them ALLOW for
       any authenticated user with no grants at all (issue #289). ``DELETE
       /mlflow-artifacts/artifacts/.`` reaches ``delete_artifacts(".")`` and recursively
       empties every experiment's artifacts; the GET enumerates every experiment id.

    3. The path names something we cannot decompose -> fall back to the configured
       default, exactly as before. This branch exists because denying here caused a total
       outage: an artifact root with a prefix this parser cannot break down (a
       per-experiment ``artifact_location``, or a per-workspace ``default_artifact_root``,
       which this plugin's own workspace API exposes) yields paths like
       ``team-a/proj/{run_id}/artifacts``. Denying those refuses every read, write and
       delete for the user who legitimately holds MANAGE, and because the store is never
       consulted NO grant can restore access — only the admin bypass. Failing closed on a
       path we merely failed to PARSE is not a security win, it is an outage.

    So the fail-closed behaviour is deliberately scoped to the shapes that are provably
    root-scoped, not to everything unresolvable. Case 3 is no worse than before this
    change; cases 1 and 2 are both strictly better.

    This does NOT change ``DEFAULT_MLFLOW_PERMISSION`` globally (see #80).
