"""OAuth client registry for the FastAPI application.

Unit tests expect the module attribute `oauth` to be an instance of
`authlib.integrations.starlette_client.OAuth`.

Registration stays lazy so importing this module needs no OIDC configuration and performs no
network calls.

**One client per provider** (issue #315). Previously there was a single global client hardcoded
as ``"oidc"`` with a one-shot registration flag, which cannot express more than one identity
provider. Clients are now registered per provider id from the registry landed in #308.

The legacy name is preserved deliberately: the ``default`` provider registers under the authlib
name ``"oidc"``, so ``oauth.oidc`` keeps resolving for every existing call site and test. A
deployment that configures no registry gets a synthesised ``default`` provider from the flat
``OIDC_*`` variables, so nothing about its behaviour changes.

Client secrets are **not** read from the registry. ``ProviderConfig`` has no secret field, on
purpose: the registry is declarative configuration that may sit in a JSON file or an env var,
and secrets belong in the secrets manager. Each additional provider takes its secret from
``OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_<PROVIDER_ID>`` resolved through the normal config chain, so the existing
providers (Vault, AWS, Azure) keep working.
