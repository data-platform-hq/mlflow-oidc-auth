"""Every artifact-proxy route MLflow serves must reach an authorization check (issue #283).

`_is_proxy_artifact_path` previously matched only the `/api/2.0` prefix and only the
`artifacts/` family. MLflow also serves the proxy under `/ajax-api/2.0` — the prefix the
web UI itself uses — and in the `mpu/{create,complete,abort}` (write) and `presigned`
(read) families. An unmatched path reaches no validator and `before_request_hook` allows
it, so any authenticated user could read and write another workspace's artifacts.
