"""The per-request auth-path query budget (issue #305).

``AuthMiddleware.dispatch`` runs on every request that is not on an unprotected prefix.
Whatever it costs is paid by every API call and every UI navigation, so it is the one
number the enterprise-identity work (epic #304) is budgeted against.

These tests pin that budget. They are exact assertions, so a regression *and* a silent
improvement both fail and have to be acknowledged in a diff — same discipline as
``test_query_counts.py`` (issue #253).

The budget, measured by ``scripts/bench_auth_path.py`` and recorded in
``docs/performance-baseline.md``:

===============  ===================
scenario         SQL statements
===============  ===================
unprotected      0
session          1
bearer           2
basic            3
===============  ===================

The session path was 2 until #310 moved sessions server-side: resolving the cookie's opaque id
joins ``auth_sessions`` to ``users`` and returns the session's validity together with the admin
and active flags, so the request that used to cost a lookup *and* a profile read now costs one
statement. Lower is allowed; it simply has to be acknowledged here rather than drift.

**No task may raise these numbers.** A change that needs more per-request data must fit
it into the existing statements (widen the ``load_only``) or cache it — not add a query.

See ``conftest.py`` for why round-trips, not query cost, are the metric.
