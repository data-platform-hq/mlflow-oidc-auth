# MLflow OIDC Auth

An authentication and authorization plugin for [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) that adds OpenID Connect (OIDC) single sign-on, role-based access control (RBAC), and per-resource permission management to MLflow tracking servers.

## Features

- **OIDC single sign-on** — Authenticate users via any OpenID Connect provider (Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Google, etc.)
- **Multiple auth methods** — Session cookies (browser), JWT bearer tokens (service-to-service), and basic auth (CLI/SDK)
- **User-level permissions** — Assign READ, USE, EDIT, or MANAGE permissions to individual users per resource
- **Group-based access control** — Organize users into groups with shared permissions, synchronized from the OIDC provider
- **Regex pattern permissions** — Define permissions using regular expressions that match resource names (e.g., `^prod-.*` → READ for all production experiments)
- **Workspace support** — Multi-tenant resource isolation with workspace-scoped experiments, models, webhooks, and trash (requires MLflow >=3.10)
- **AI Gateway permissions** — Control access to MLflow AI Gateway endpoints, secrets, and model definitions
- **Prompt and scorer permissions** — Fine-grained access control for MLflow prompts and scorers
- **Webhook management** — Create, test, and manage workspace-scoped webhooks through the admin UI
- **Trash management** — View, restore, and permanently delete experiments and runs from the admin UI
- **Admin UI** — React-based management interface for permissions, users, groups, webhooks, and trash
- **Pluggable configuration** — Load secrets from AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, or environment variables
- **Pluggable cache backend** — In-process TTL cache (default) or shared Redis for multi-replica permission invalidation
- **JWT audience validation** — Optional `aud` claim enforcement to prevent token confusion attacks
- **Trusted proxy validation** — CIDR-based validation of `X-Forwarded-*` headers for secure reverse proxy deployments
- **ReDoS protection** — Regex pattern validation with length limits and nested quantifier detection
- **Permission caching** — TTL-based caching of permission resolution results with automatic invalidation on writes
- **GraphQL authorization** — Permission enforcement on MLflow's GraphQL API
- **Health probes** — Kubernetes-compatible liveness, readiness, and startup health check endpoints
- **MLflow UI integration** — Injects sign-in/sign-out links and permission management navigation into the built-in MLflow UI

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install mlflow-oidc-auth
```

### 2. Configure

Create a `.env` file with your OIDC provider settings:

```bash
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OIDC_GROUP_NAME=mlflow
OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME=mlflow-admin
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key
```

If your OIDC provider issues a public client (no client secret), omit `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` — PKCE, which is on by default, authenticates the token exchange instead:

```bash
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OIDC_GROUP_NAME=mlflow
OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME=mlflow-admin
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key
```

### 3. Run

```bash
mlflow --env-file .env server --app-name oidc-auth --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Or use the wrapper CLI that supports cloud secret providers:

```bash
mlflow-oidc-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### 4. Access

- **MLflow UI**: `http://localhost:8080/` — Redirects to OIDC login
- **Admin UI**: `http://localhost:8080/oidc/ui/` — Permission management interface
- **Health**: `http://localhost:8080/health/ready` — Readiness probe

## How It Works

The plugin runs as a FastAPI application that wraps MLflow's Flask server:

1. **FastAPI** handles OIDC authentication, the admin UI, permission management API, and health endpoints
2. **Flask** (MLflow's native app) handles the core MLflow tracking API (experiments, runs, models)
3. **Before-request hooks** intercept every MLflow API call and enforce RBAC before the request reaches MLflow
4. **After-request hooks** auto-grant permissions on resource creation, filter search results, and cascade permission deletes

Authentication context flows from FastAPI middleware through an ASGI-to-WSGI bridge into Flask, so all layers share the same user identity and admin status.
